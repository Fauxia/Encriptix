                <h3><em style="font-weight: 600;">Khan</em> made his debut at the age of 16 in Lahore. By the start of
                    the 1970s, he was playing for his
                    home teams of Lahore A (1969–1970), Lahore B (1969–1970), Lahore Greens (1970–1971), and eventually
                    Lahore (1970–1971). Khan made his Test cricket debut against England in June 1971 at Edgbaston.[76]
                    Three years later, in August 1974, he debuted in the One Day International (ODI) match, once again
                    playing against England at Trent Bridge for the Prudential Trophy.[76] After graduating from Oxford
                    and finishing his tenure at Worcestershire, he returned to Pakistan in 1976 and secured a permanent
                    place on his native national team starting from the 1976–1977 season, during which they faced New
                    Zealand and Australia.</h3>

            <p class="khan">Khan was offered political positions more than a few times during his cricketing career. In
                1987,
                President Zia-ul-Haq offered him a political position in the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) which he
                politely declined. Khan ended the campaign by addressing a rally of supporters in Islamabad via a video
                link while lying on a bed at a hospital in Lahore.[204] The last survey before the elections by The
                Herald showed 24.98 percent of voters nationally planned to vote for his party, just a whisker behind
                former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's PML-N.</p>
